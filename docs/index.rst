Welcome to Pymeerkat's documentation!
=====================================
This projects is meant to aid python junkies to easily access the [Meerkat API](https://meerkatapp.co/developers).
In particular we aim to provide access to a stream of images for each broadcast for image processing/vision tasks.
Our goal is to enable people to utlize this information to come up with better heuristics to categorize streams.
